# Project Euler support library

This is a compilation of functions packaged together as 3 different libraries that I have found useful for solving project euler problems.

It contains 4 individual libraries each dealing with different types of problems:

linear - a light-weight linear algebra library.
nums - number theory 
big_int - large number computations
perms - utilities for generating permutations and itterating all choices
